The head is well-rounded, apple-shaped, and the muzzle is short and pointed with a well-defined stop. ","An elegant, observant, swift-moving, compact little dog with saucy expression, and with terrier-like qualities of temperament. ","Most historical references of the Chihuahua can be termed bewildering and obscure. A number of theories prevail regarding the origin of the breed. Both folklore and archaeological findings hint towards the fact that the breed originated in Mexico. Arguably, the most relevant theory is that the Chihuahuas descended from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization in Mexico.","Chihuahuas are prone to rheumatism, slipped stifle, colds and gum problems, corneal dryness and secondary glaucoma, due to their protruding eyes. They suffer from the tendency of gaining weight effortlessly. Exercise caution with toxic products, such as chocolate or fertilizers. This is a very small breed and it will not take much to poison the dogs of this breed. Chihuahuas are often born via a cesarean section because puppies are born with relatively large heads. They are susceptible to fractures and other mishaps in puppyhood. Some Chihuahuas have a molera, an unclosed section of the skull which can remain open forever. This makes the dog prone to injury. It has a tendency to wheeze and snore because of its small, short muzzles. This dog breed is vulnerable to stress, caused by the owners’ tendency to treat them like little babies. ",These little dogs are cut out for an apartment life. The Chihuahua adores warm weather and coldness repels it. They need space just like any other dog. Their small size does not imply that they can be kept in a small and confined space.,"Although it is tempting to travel outside very often with these dainty creatures, in actuality, such little dogs only need one daily walk. Proper and sufficient play can address most of their exercise needs, however, as is the case with all the breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that are left out of daily walks are more likely to display a wide variety of behavior problems, as well as neurotic issues. They will also savor a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large, fenced-in yard.","The smooth, short haired coat should be gently brushed occasionally or simply wiped over with a damp cloth. The long coat should be brushed daily with a soft bristle brush. Bathe both types about once per month, while adopting precautionary measures to preclude water from penetrating the ears.

Both the front and back legs are in proportion with the size of the dog. The topline is even. The tail is set and carried high. It is sometimes docked to half its length or less to give the dog a more compact and balanced look.","The poodle is an industrious, wise and graceful dog, squarely built, and well-proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes, which are very dark in color and oval in shape, are a thorough reflection of its wakeful and astute nature. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.","Long before the Poodle was brought to England, the European mainland was well acquainted with the breed. Drawings by German artist Albrecht Dürer established the popular image of the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries. The paintings of the eminent Spanish artist Fransisco Goya are a testimony to the fact that it was the cardinal pet dog of the late 18th century in Spain. During the regime of Louis XVI, people in the neighboring France pampered and fancied toy poodles a lot.","They are vulnerable to cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which may cause blindness, IMHA (Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia), heart problems, diabetes, epilepsy, runny eyes, ear infections and skin allergies. Brown Poodles are known for become prematurely","The Miniature Poodle is very much equipped to lead a settled apartment life. It will always be in a pleasant mind frame indoors, provided that enough exercise is given to it. A yard is non-essential for a poodle.","Miniature Poodles need a daily walk. While out on the walk make sure the dog heels beside or behind the person holding the lead, never in front, (this is essential as loyalty towards humans makes dogs set great store by them). As with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to build up behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe, open area off lead, such as a large, fenced-in yard. ","An enormous amount of grooming is needed if the dog is to be shown. Poodles must be bathed regularly and clipped every six to eight weeks. Clean and check the ears frequently for wax or mites or infection and pull out hairs growing inside the ear canal. The teeth need regular scaling. Since the coat does not shed, it needs to be clipped.","There are a myriad of positive characteristics that make the poodle a pet lover’s choice. This dog is tremendously witty and persevering. Therefore, training of any kind would be readily accepted and mastered in a very short amount of time. The dog is the best choice for people set back by certain health issues as it is devoid of shedding.The sheer number of colors in which a Poodle is available makes it one of the most prized dogs. For instance, the Poodle comes in solid colors of white, gray, black, brown, apricot, cream, silver, and café-au-lait.","Grooming is not that essential, but since haircuts would be required every five to six weeks, be ready to bear the additional expenses. Exercising is a prerequisite for a poodle. Hence, if you lack a fenced backyard or someone in the family willing to provide daily walks and playtime, it is better to turn a blind eye to the Poodle. Nonetheless, if the activity needs of this breed could be met in a different manner, this would not be much of a headache."

,Pembroke Welsh Corgi,pembroke.jpg,Pembrokeshire,11,14,9,13,25,30,23,29,12,15,5,6,"Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an active and intelligent dog breed. Easy to train and eager to learn, Pembroke’s are great with children and other pets, and you can find them in four different coat colours and markings. Adaptable and loving with the whole family, Corgis can fit into just about any household, whether it’s an apartment or a large home with a yard. However, they do have quite a bit of energy for a small dog. They’ll need plenty of walks and active play sessions. You might be surprised by how quickly these short-legged pups can move! For humans who can meet the breed’s needs, the Pembroke will make an excellent family companion, even for novice pet parents.","The Pembroke Welsh corgi is a small- to medium-sized herding dog of short stature and sturdy build. Known for its low-set body, large erect ears, and stubby tail, the Pembroke also has a reputation for being a wonderful companion. Pembroke Welsh corgis are achondroplastic, a dwarf breed with shortened legs. They are the shortest breed of the herding dog group. Pembrokes have slightly smaller builds than Cardigans, their ears are pointier, and they have short stubby tails, as opposed to the long tail of the Cardigan.","Originating in Pembrokeshire, Wales, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an enchanting dog whose background is steeped in folklore. According to Welsh legend, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sprang from the lairs of fairies and elves! For those who don't believe in fairy tales, there are historians who say that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is descended from Vallhunds, Swedish cattle dogs that were brought to Wales by the Vikings in the 9th and 10th centuries. Others think they may have been descended from dogs that were brought to Wales by Flemish weavers in the 12th century....In the 1920s, the UK Kennel Club recognized Corgis as purebred dogs. They were officially known as Welsh Corgis when exhibited for the first time in 1925. At that time, Pembrokes and Cardigans were shown in the same class as one breed. Then, in 1934, the Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan as two separate breeds. In that same year, the American Kennel Club followed suit. Pembrokes were first shown in the U.S. in 1936. Pembrokes have slowly gained in popularity in the U.S., and today, are among the top 50 most popular breeds for family pets. They're also popular with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England, who received her first Pembroke Welsh Corgi from her father (King George VI) in 1933. The puppy's name was Rozavel Golden Eagle and was a playmate for Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret. Elizabeth has loved the little dogs ever since, and currently has a pack of them lounging around Buckingham Palace.","Pembrokes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pembrokes will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed. If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show your health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pembrokes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopaedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website (offa.org). With a Pembroke Welsh Corgi one should be careful about these illnesses: Hip Dysplasia, Cataracts, Cutaneous Asthenia, Cystinuria, Epilepsy, etc. Athletic and surprisingly fast, Pembrokes were bred to be herding dogs and require plenty of exercises each day. That said, they make fine apartment dogs as long as they get the physical stimulation they need. With their short legs and long backs, they should not be expected to hop up on (or down from) the couch or any other modest height — fractures are common. Corgis can adapt quite easily to living in the country or the city. Although their coats are weather-resistant and they do well in most climates, they are very people-oriented and need to be a part of the family at all times — not left alone in the backyard.","They require only quick, weekly grooming except in times of shedding. They need to be watched carefully for developing obesity. These dogs are easy to keep and do well with a minimal amount of food. Added weight can be an extra strain on the long, low back. They are quick to learn tricks and seem to have a sense of humour. They are excellent watchdogs if anything prone to unnecessary alarm barking. Perhaps because of their small stature, corgis seem to be attracted to high places and may occasionally be found on the back of the sofa or in the middle of the kitchen table. Corgis do need a firm but kind hand in training.","A strong, athletic little dog developed to herd cattle and other livestock, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi loves physical activity and is happiest when he has a job to do. Corgis benefit from moderate daily exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. Pembrokes can do well on long walks or slow jogs, but their short legs won't allow them to keep up with a bicycle rider. Avoid extreme heat or cold, and always provide plenty of cool, fresh water after exercise. Many Pembrokes enjoy and excel at canine activities such as agility, herding, obedience, and tracking events.","The Pembroke has a thick, weatherproof double coat’s soft, light undercoat covered by a coarse outer coat. The breed sheds a fair amount on a daily basis, and even more so in the late spring/early summer. A daily once-over with a comb and a slicker brush will remove a lot of the shed hair before it is all over the house. During shedding season, baths help to loosen the dead hair the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins and a rake helps strip out the undercoat. As with all breeds, the Corgi's nails should be trimmed regularly, and ears checked to be sure they are clean and healthy.","Companionship, Exceptionally Smart, Sociable, Loved by Royal families.","Need daily stimulation, Need high-quality dog food, Shedding, Can get overweight very easy."
,Lhasa Apso,lhasa.jpg,Tibet,5.4,8.2,5,5.8,25,28,22,27,12,15,4,6,"The Lhasa Apso (pronounced ""LAH-Suh-AHP-so"") is a smart and wilful small dog with a big personality. They're often described as funny, merry, and eager to please. Originating in Tibet, the Lhasa was bred to be a watchdog in palaces and Buddhist monasteries high in the Himalayas. Lhasa comes from the city in Tibet and Apso is a Tibetan word that loosely translates to ""dog."" This ancestry reveals itself in modern-day Lhasa—they're alert and loyal to their owners, though often wary of strangers.","Full-grown male Lhasa apsos are about 10–11 inches tall and weigh 12–18 pounds, while female pups are slightly smaller. Lhasa apsos have gorgeous black, tan, cream, white, and/or red-coloured coats, but they can also be blue, grey, and silver, though those are less common. Their luscious locks grow long, so you might want to tie up their flowy hairdo with a scrunchie or give them a sweet ""puppy cut"" to keep fur out of their eyes. They have black and brown button noses, long beards (if their hair is kept long), and slightly longer snouts than similar snub-nosed dogs like the Pekingese.","Lhasa apsos have a regal history that begins in 800 B.C. Tibet, when they were bred as sentinel dogs who stood watch inside palaces and Buddhist monasteries high in the Himalayan mountains, according to the ALAC. Legend has it, the brave little Lhasa apsos inspired this ancient Tibetan saying: ""If the snow-lion stays in the mountains, it is a snow-lion; if it comes down to the valleys, it becomes a dog."" Lhasas have held popular status with Buddhist monks and Dalai Lamas over the centuries—they were never sold, and thus a highly prized gift. Some Tibetian Buddhists believe that the souls of lamas (priests) are reborn as Lhasa apsos in the stage of reincarnation just before they are reborn as humans, according to the ALAC. Lhasa apsos first came to the West in the early 19th century, landing in the U.S. (specifically, New Jersey) in 1933 after being gifted to a couple by the Dalai Lama. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed just two years later, and the ALAC was founded in 1959.","The Lhasa apso is a generally healthy breed but can be prone to health problems like hip dysplasia and patellar luxation. According to the American Lhasa Apso Club (ALAC), they may also deal with eye issues like retinal atrophy, pigmentary keratitis, dry eye, and glaucoma. Other common health issues for Lhasa apsos include cherry eye (a red mass at the inner corner of the dog's eye), allergies, and a genetic skin condition called sebaceous adenitis, where the sebaceous glands become inflamed. Lhasa apsos can also be susceptible to haemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE), a life-threatening disease that can occur in small and medium-sized dog breeds, according to the ALAC. If you catch the warning signs (like bloody diarrhoea) early, the condition can be cured. With the right care, Lhasa apsos live long lives—about 12–15 years on average. Some have even been reported to have lived well into their 20s. If you buy a Lhasa from a breeder, it's important that they be reputable and dedicated to maintaining healthy animals. The Lhasa apso breeder should be able to show you lineage records that prove their dogs are healthy enough for breeding.","Lhasas are loyal to their tribe and do well with adults and children who respect their boundaries. Lhasas can make great family pets—even with small children—as long as the children understand (with the parents' direction) to give the dog some space. If properly socialized and trained, Lhasas can get along with other dogs and pets but know that Lhasa can like to be the boss. Lhasas will tolerate being left alone for reasonable periods of time, but think twice if you have neighbours who would be disturbed by any warning barking while you're away. They are not a 'yappy' dog, but with their keen hearing, they will alert you of unexpected events. Their small size might make them seem like ideal apartment dogs, but their bark might prove otherwise. Lhasa apsos are quick on their little legs! These pups can excel in agility, where they'll get the exercise and mental stimulation to make them happy. Lhasas need a moderate amount of exercise. A 20-minute walk once or twice a day and some playtime in the house or yard, especially during the puppy stage, will do.","The Lhasa is generally not a couch potato and is adept at self-exercise. They will race around an apartment to run off energy, entertain themselves in a fenced yard, or take their owners on a brisk walk. Mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise. They excel at agility, can do scent work, and have been known to retrieve and herd. There are talented Lhasas certified as therapy dogs working in hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, and prisons.","When it comes to grooming, the Lhasa apso is definitely high-maintenance. Though she doesn't shed much, her long and lavish coat can get quite tangled and matted if not cared for correctly—daily brushing and a bi-monthly bath is recommended. Some owners opt to keep their dog's coat short in a ""puppy cut"" style so that it's easier to maintain, but both hairdos are equally adorable and aww-worthy. Lhasas will also need basic grooming every couple of weeks beyond their hair care, including nail trims and teeth brushing. Experts recommend brushing your dog's teeth every day if possible. Just make sure to use dog toothpaste, because human toothpaste is toxic for dogs! Her ears also need to be checked and cleaned regularly. Your Lhasa should eat dog food made from high-quality ingredients. Monitoring her food and exercise is an important part of care, preventing your dog from gaining an unhealthy amount of weight. A visit to your vet can help you determine how much and how often to feed your Lhasa to keep her healthy.","Friendly and Affectionate, Requires Frequent Grooming, Protective","Stubborn, Excellent Lifespan, Fragile"

For instance, a savory desert coursing called Tazi (sag-e- tazi) is reminiscent of a breed known as Tazi (another name for Afghan Hound) that can be related to the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan. Some other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region along the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.",Generally healthy.,"The Afghan Hound cannot acclimatize itself to a typical apartment life. They are quite indolent indoors and they can immaculately blend themselves with acreages. Even though the Afghan Hound can live both indoors and outdoors, when it comes to sleeping, an indoor environment suits them the most. On balance, it can be surmised that they are tailor-made for external environment.","It is essential to take the Afghan Hound on a long daily walk or jog. While walking or jogging, it is advisable to make the dog heel beside or behind the person preceding him. This is because a dog has utmost respect for a human leader that shows him the way. If this breed is kept detached from walking on a daily basis, it might be afflicted with behavioral issues. The trainer should indoctrinate them in the need to enter and exit doors and gateways after the humans. They also adore running freely in an open, fenced, safe area.","The long, thick coat is aesthetic enough to capture the imagination of any person. To keep the dog in a hygienic condition, bathe it when necessary. Do not brush in between baths in order to keep the coat long and luminous. Brushing a dry coat will roughen and harm the coat, as well as make it more easily matted. Weekly baths do not matter that much if your Afghan Hound is a pet and not going to be exposed to the external environment, but doing so will make the coat less matted and save you time in the long run. Many wear snoods indoors to safeguard their ears from food bowls. Some owners prefer to use a special air- cushioned brush, called a pinbrush. This breed is an average shredder.","Finesse, smartness and glamour get a whole new meaning with Afghan hounds. They can be the real deal for owners eyeing dogs of relatively larger size as they are quite lightweight. Since this breed features a contiguous and smooth coat that does not shed, it is not cumbersome","Grooming this dog is a must. This is because the dog’s coat is really long. If the coat is not brushed regularly, it will get matted and may become disheveled. Whenever the hounds are exposed to fenced yards, leashes should be employed because their instinct compels them to chase and hunt down smaller animals like rabbits."

Small hounds find mention in the Forest Laws of Canute, which exempted them from the ordinance that commanded that all dogs capable of running down a stag should have one foot mutilated. However, there are divergent opinions regarding the time of existence of such laws. If they indeed existed in practice, they lend weight to the fact that such dogs were prevalent in England prior to 1016.","Some dogs of this breed can be susceptible to a multitude of diseases, including epilepsy, heart disease, eye and back problems, chondroplasia, popularly termed as dwarfism (warped front legs, like a Basset's), mast cell tumors, etc.     ","Beagles can live pleasantly in an apartment if they are not provided with ample opportunities to roam outdoors. They tend to stay vibrant indoors, and a small yard will suffice.","Being endowed with qualities of dynamism and stamina, lots of exercise, including a brisk daily walk, is a prerequisite for the Beagle. There should have a fenced yard of reasonable size for romping the breed. Always use a lead when taking this breed out for a walk or you may lose track of the swift-legged dog very quickly.","Nurturing the Beagle's smooth, shorthaired coat is no different from having a walk in the park. Brush it with a firm bristle brush, and bathe it with mild soap only when the need arises. Dry shampoo occasionally. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection and keep the nails trimmed. This breed is an average shedder."," Beagles are quite capable of fetching and returning a variety of items, like balls and plush toys. They are an intelligent breed, and when trained as pups, can be rendered disciplined and mannerly. Beagles have the potential of learning and understanding pet owners' commands, if trained at an early age or taken to attend some obedience classes. They are also known for mixing and mingling with children, other dogs and even cats, if acquainted early. They are frisky, and easy to maintain, clean and groom. Since it is a neat and tidy breed, it necessitates an occasional bathing and brushing at times.","As they have a penchant for digging and chewing on things, pet owners need to distract the dog by buying chewable toys and bones for the beagles or they could run the risk of having their own personal items chewed and buried. Absent-mindedness and inattentiveness of a beagle makes it a headache to train it. As a result, pet owners must repeat dog commands and demands quite a number of times before it becomes an obedient dog. Furthermore, beagles howl very loud, and they learn this kind of barking, a part and parcel of their hunting activities, when they are pups."

There is a lot in common between the features of Bullmastiff and those of the molosser dogs. The breed boasts of ancestral connections with the English mastiff and the extinct Old English Mastiff,"The large, broad skull is crinkly and the muzzle is broad, deep and usually darker in color. The forehead is flat and the stop is moderate. The black nose is wide and has large nostrils. The teeth converge in a level or undershot bite. The medium sized eyes are dark hazel. The V-shaped ears are set high and wide, carried close to the cheeks, giving a square appearance to the skull. The strong tail is set high, thicker at the root and tapers gradually. It is either straight or curved, and reaches to the hocks. The back is short, straight and even between the withers and the loin. The short, dense, slightly rough coat comes in brindle, fawn, or red, often with black markings on the head.","Bred by English gamekeepers in the 19th century to assist English wardens or gamekeepers guard estates and capture poachers. That is why, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog. The gamekeepers opted for the brindle color, as it serves primarily as an effective camouflage, especially at night.","This dog breed is prone to mast cell tumors, cancer, hip dysplasia, tumors, eyelid problems, PRA and boils on the lips, bloat. It is advisable to feed the Bull Mastiff two or three small meals daily instead of providing one large meal. As this breed gains weight easily, overfeeding is forbidden.","Bullmastiffs can adjust themselves to an apartment if they are adequately exercised. They are quite lethargic indoors, and a small yard can do them a world of good. They are, however, ill-equipped to endure the oppressive heat.","Bullmastiffs need to be taken on a daily walk to fulfill their primal canine instinct to migrate. Those individuals who fail in fulfilling this need are more likely to confront behavior issues. While out on the walk, the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person leading the way forward (this is essential as loyalty towards humans makes dogs set great store by them). Teach them to enter and exit all door and gateways after the human.","The short haired, slightly rough coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, and shampoo only when necessary. There is little shedding with this breed.

,Boxer,boxer.jpg,Germany,25,32,25,32,57,63,53,60,9,10,6,8,"Boxers are known for bursting with energy and plenty of exercise is a prerequisite for them. You should have the time, resolve, and vigour to give them the play and activity they need. Boxers are exuberant and will greet you ecstatically.","The Boxer's body is compact and sturdy. The size of the head is in proportion to that of the body. The muzzle is short and blunt with a distinct stop. The nose is large and black with very open nostrils. The jaw has an under bite. The eyes are dark brown in color. The ears are set high, either cropped or kept natural. When cropped, they are trained to stand up on the head, tapering to a point. When left in their natural form, the ears are thin, falling forward, lying close to the head. The neck should be round, strong and muscular, without a dewlap. The muscular front legs seem to be straight and parallel when viewed from the front. The back legs are muscular. The tail is set high and usually docked. The AKC severely penalizes a natural tail, while most of Europe has outlawed this practice. Dewclaws are usually removed. The short, smooth, close-fitting coat comes in fawn, brindle, tan, mahogany and black often with white markings. Boxers with a white coat cannot be registered with some clubs.","The breed burst onto the scene in different areas of Europe in the late 19th century and in the United States towards the turn of the 20th century. The American Kennel Club (AKC) registered the first Boxer in 1904, and acknowledged the first Boxer champion, Dampf vom Dom, in 1915. During World War I, the Boxer was co-opted for military work, embracing the role of a key messenger dog, pack-carrier, attack dog, and guard dog.","The bull dogs can be vulnerable to cardiomyopathy and other heart problems, sub-aortic stenosis and thyroid, skin and other allergies, epilepsy. They are more likely to pick up tumor-related diseases compared to other breeds. They are, moreover, quite susceptible to cancer, mast cell tumors, arthritis, hip dysplasia, back and knee issues. These dogs may drool and snore. The breed has excessive flatulence, especially when fed something other than their own dog food. Some white Boxers are prone to deafness.","Boxers will fit into an apartment quite well if sufficiently exercised. They are buzzing with energy and vigor in indoor conditions and at least an average-sized yard is a necessity for them. Boxers are temperature-sensitive, getting easily overheated and chilling very quickly.","An active, athletic breed, Boxers need daily work or exercise, as well as a long brisk, daily walk. They also enjoy fetching a ball or other sessions of play.","The Boxer's smooth, shorthaired coat is easy to groom. Brush with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when necessary, for it removes the natural oils from the skin. Some Boxers try and keep themselves clean, grooming themselves like a cat, although some cannot resist rolling in another animal’s poop, which calls for a bath. This breed is an average shedder.","The pros of owning an English bulldog are so many that they can easily overpower the cons. There are exiguous dogs that have the same degree of stoicism as the bulldog, thereby making it the quintessential family pet. Children adore these dogs immensely. Bull dogs are known for their fidelity and affectionate attitude. They are the perfect “nanny” dog for children, and equally favoured by the elderly, not dashing around their feet and tripping them and large enough for them to be easily seen.The English bulldog, once he has surpassed the lively puppy stage, becomes stolid and sluggish, heavy and ponderous, and can hardly be provoked. Finding a short-tempered bulldog is out of the bounds of possibility.","There are some demerits of owning an English bulldog. He is definitely not easy to train due to his obdurateness; the bulldog will consume quite a lot of time to learn things, albeit once he has grasped something, it will be stamped on his memory forever. Food is the key to bulldog training (a system of rewards is the backbone of a suitable training mechanism as it makes them quite responsive and engaged).As a breed, the bulldog is an avid eater. So, the owner has to be pragmatic and ration food amounts to avoid this heavy breed from becoming seriously overweight."

However, this dog breed is gradually dwindling and almost heading towards the stage of extinction, with Tamil Nadu being the sole Indian state to be the home to a small number of dogs of this breed. Of late, multiple efforts and initiatives have been undertaken to promote the breed and enhance their popularity in the nation.","Most Rajapalyam owners favor a milk white-colored dog, with a pink nose and golden eyes. However, the Rajapalyam breed is also discernible in various other colors, including spotted or solid, black, and brown. The spots will start appearing nearly 80 days after their birth. In the previous times, colored puppies were usually culled from the litters since the owners preferred the pure white dogs. The coat of these dogs is short and fine in nature. An incredibly eye-catching and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam consists of a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse. Most of the entirely white dogs are beset by deafness, and this breed is not an exception to this norm either.","Rajapalayam hounds were primarily bred and used by the Nayakar dynasty of Tamil Nadu. It is speculated by some researchers that the Rajapalayam may have been one of the dogs used in the breeding of the modern Dalmatian. The Rajapalayam dog was pressed into service during the Carnatic Wars and Polygar War to launch an offensive against the British cavalry in battles as Rajapalayams were quite swift, powerful and pugnacious while tackling the opponents. It is also believed that 4 Rajapalayams not only saved the life of their master combating a tiger, but also valiantly drove the tiger to its death many years ago near a forest in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu. They are extensively used to protect the rice fields, houses and farms. In the last two decades, Indian Army started using them as guard dogs to support the army in the border regions of Kashmir.","Rajapalayams are, in general, a salubrious breed.

The short, black coat is highlighted with clearly defined markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, chest, lower legs and under the tail.","Rottweilers descend from the Molossus, a mastiff-type dog. Their ancestors marched to Germany with the Romans, driving the cattle that sustained them as they conquered the known world. As the army traveled, the big dogs mated with dogs that were native to the areas they passed through and laid the foundation for new breeds.They were originally used for activities like cattle herding, bear hunting, pulling carts, guarding properties.

Suitable for living in small spaces , such as an apartment if sufficiently excercised.","While going on walks is vital for your rottweiler, there are other ways you can exercise him in addition to taking hikes. Playing fetch in the yard is a good way of working off some extra energy and is essential if your dog can't run off the lead while on his walks. You might also want to take part in sort kind of activity, such as agility or heel-work to music, which will give your canine companion some exercise, while also teaching him obedience skills.","Brush the Rottweiler on a weekly basis to remove loose hair and distribute natural skin oils to help keep the coat shiny and healthy.

Legs of Bernard’s are generally muscular. They adapt well to a living apartment. bernards body is a bit on the muscular side. Saint Bernard’s are mostly known as nanny dogs,"The head is broad with well-developed cheekbones, the muzzle is not tapered and a deep furrow runs from the muzzle attachment up between the eyes. The ears are medium in size, set high atop the head and stand away from the head at the base, with the flaps drooping towards the head. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The dark brown eyes are set front. The neck is thick. The broad back is perfectly straight. The tail is long and bushy and may be carried slightly bent upward. The coat comes in short and long varieties and may be red, red with white, or brindle with white.","There is ample evidence that the dog breed is a primitive one. Using the credible written or visual evidence available, it is quite a daunting task to establish a linkage between the breed of the present times and specific Afghan owners or places. Dog maniacs, non-scientific breed books and websites chronicle enough information lending credence to the fact that the Afghan Hound has emanated from the prehistoric era. The ties shared by the breed with other types and breeds from the same area can act as a vivid reflection or mirror of the history. For instance, a savory desert coursing called Tazi (sag-e- tazi) is reminiscent of a breed known as Tazi (another name for Afghan Hound) that can be related to the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan. Some other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region along the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.",Generally healthy.,"The Afghan Hound cannot acclimatize itself to a typical apartment life. They are quite indolent indoors and they can immaculately blend themselves with acreages. Even though the Afghan Hound can live both indoors and outdoors, when it comes to sleeping, an indoor environment suits them the most. On balance, it can be surmised that they are tailor-made for external environment.","It is essential to take the Afghan Hound on a long daily walk or jog. While walking or jogging, it is advisable to make the dog heel beside or behind the person preceding him. This is because a dog has utmost respect for a human leader that shows him the way. If this breed is kept detached from walking on a daily basis, it might be afflicted with behavioral issues. The trainer should indoctrinate them in the need to enter and exit doors and gateways after the humans. They also adore running freely in an open, fenced, safe area.","The long, thick coat is aesthetic enough to capture the imagination of any person. To keep the dog in a hygienic condition, bathe it when necessary. Do not brush in between baths in order to keep the coat long and luminous. Brushing a dry coat will roughen and harm the coat, as well as make it more easily matted. Weekly baths do not matter that much if your Afghan Hound is a pet and not going to be exposed to the external environment, but doing so will make the coat less matted and save you time in the long run. Many wear snoods indoors to safeguard their ears from food bowls. Some owners prefer to use a special air- cushioned brush, called a pinbrush. This breed is an average shredder.","Finesse, smartness and glamour get a whole new meaning with Afghan hounds. They can be the real deal for owners eyeing dogs of relatively larger size as they are quite lightweight. Since this breed features a contiguous and smooth coat that does not shed, it is not cumbersome","Grooming this dog is a must. This is because the dog’s coat is really long. If the coat is not brushed regularly, it will get matted and may become disheveled. Whenever the hounds are exposed to fenced yards, leashes should be employed because their instinct compels them to chase and hunt down smaller animals like rabbits."

Eye color comes in shades of brown. The pendant ears are V-shaped, hanging forward close to the head. The neck is muscular and arched with a moderate dewlap. The dewlap is more prominent in males than in females. The topline is level. The feathered tail is curled over the back. The front legs are straight with feathering. The feet are cat-like and may have feathering between the toes. Dewclaws are sometimes removed"," In the early 20th century, King George V introduced a pair of Tibetan Mastiffs, and enough of the breeds were available in England in 1906 to be exhibited at the Crystal Palace show. However, during the gloomy days of the World War, the breed lost its glory and charm. In the long run, the breed almost became extinct in the country of England.","They are prone to hip dysplasia, thyroid problems, skin conditions and ear infections, a genetic problem called Canine Inherited Demyelinative Neuropathy (CIDN), which is fatal.

While out on the walk, the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Be sure to exercise caution so that the bones, muscles and joints of the young dog do not get subjected to excessive pressure during the growing stage by not overtaxing the physical side of its life. However, because of their migration instinct, they will still need to walk on a daily basis.","The Tibetan Mastiff should be brushed regularly. In the winter season, the coat has an abundance of very thick hair, which sheds once a year (during the sultry summers) for the duration of a month. During this time period, your dog should be brushed and combed every day. The Tibetan Mastiff is sometimes beneficial for allergy sufferers, depending on the individual and the type of allergy they have.","There are a plethora of merits of owning a giant breed dog.

The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As small dogs bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some dogs love to dig holes and chase cats, but Shih Tzu's idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV. ","The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a small muzzle and normally has large dark brown eyes. They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. Floppy ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any colour, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.","When you own a Shih Tzu, you own a little bit of Chinese history. Imperial breeders in the palace of the Chinese emperor developed the Shih Tzu (meaning “lion dog”) centuries ago from Tibetan breeding stock. The breed is most likely the product of crosses of two even older Sino-Tibetan breeds, the Lhasa Apso and the Pekingese. For hundreds of years, Shih Tzu lived the life of royal lap warmers and was pampered by emperors and their families. It is said emperors would give valuable gifts to breeders of Shih Tzu who produced the most beautiful and affectionate dogs. The breed remained hidden behind palace walls, virtually unknown to the outside world, until the 1930s. Breed clubs formed in Peking and later England further refined the breed, not without much debate among fanciers as to proper type. The Shih Tzu entered the AKC Stud Book in 1969. Since then, the Shih Tzu has been one of the most popular toy dogs here and in the United Kingdom. And they still treat their owners, no matter who they might be, like royalty. Owners as diverse as Queen Elizabeth II and Miley Cyrus have succumbed to the Shih Tzu’s exotic charms.","Because of their heavy coats and short faces, Shih Tzus do not tolerate heat well and are not good swimmers. Most Shih Tzu are generally healthy, and responsible breeders screen their stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (a slipped kneecap), eye anomalies including cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, retinal detachment, and corneal dryness and inflammation from excessive exposure to the air because of improperly closing eyelids.","Much of what you can do to keep your dog happy and healthy is common sense, just like it is for people. Watch her diet, make sure she gets plenty of exercise, regularly brush her teeth and coat, and call us or a pet emergency hospital when something seems unusual.

Remember to comb the moustache and topknot daily, and gently clean the corner of the eyes with a damp cloth. To protect the Shih Tzu's eyes from being irritated, the hair on the top of the head should be trimmed short or tied up into a topknot.

,French Bulldog,french_bulldog.jpg,France,8,14,8,14,24,35,20,30,11,12,6,8,"Bred primarily as companion dogs, Frenchies crave all the love and affection we humans have to offer. They’re just as satisfied playing with kids and other dogs as they are being a couch potato. Goofy, yet intelligent, French bulldogs make an easygoing best friend for any dog lover.","While they may not have the same handsome elegance of a golden retriever, the French bulldog is undeniably charming. They have a small, compact body that's well-proportioned and fairly muscular, with the exception of the wrinkled skin around their face and shoulders. Frenchies most often come in colours like cream, fawn, and white, but they can also have brindle patterns or black masks. They have trademark dark brown eyes and an adorable ""squished up"" face. Their smooth, shiny coats only require occasional brushing to stay clean, and they shed a moderate amount. A healthy full-grown French bulldog tops out at around 28 pounds, making them the miniature version of a classic bulldog (which can get up to 50 pounds). Two distinctive features of the French bulldog are its bat ears and half-flat, half-domed skull.""","The French Bulldog originated in England and was created to be a toy-size version of the Bulldog. The breed was quite popular among lace workers in the city of Nottingham and when many lace workers emigrated to France for better opportunities, they naturally brought their little bulldogs with them. The French Bulldog thrived in France and Europe, and his charm was soon discovered by Americans as well. The United States saw its first French Bulldog at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1896. The breed was quickly nicknamed ""Frenchie,"" and it is still an affectionate name that is used today.","Because of their front-heavy structure, Frenchies cannot swim and should never be left unattended near a tub, pool, or body of water. Like all flat-faced breeds, Frenchies are prone to breathing problems and do poorly in hot or humid weather. Flat-faced breeds are also more sensitive to anaesthesia. Frenchies occasionally have eye conditions such as cherry eye, juvenile cataracts, or entropion, and skin allergies and autoimmune skin disorders also are known to occur. A responsible breeder will take advantage of available tests to screen breeding stock for conditions that can affect the breed. French bulldogs require notably less exercise and grooming than many popular dog breeds, but some can use a little extra training (depending on your specific dog's needs). As long as your Frenchie is properly socialized with new people and other animals when first adopted, they should become a friendly and happy companion in your household.","A French bulldog is able to be happy in any housing. This breed is suitable for city life, because no large yard is required. He is not meant to be a jogging companion, but he is always willing to go for a brisk walk. The French bulldog does not require a lot of food, and his short coat is easy to keep clean. Facial wrinkles should be cleaned regularly. The Frenchie snorts and snores, but somehow, it's part of his appeal. He prefers to spend his time in the house, receiving all your attention.","In general, the Frenchie is more of a lapdog than a jogging partner, but routine exercise is still important with caution. This breed can easily overheat due to its short, stubby nose and potential airway problems. Daily exercise is very important, but don't overdo it: Playing with toys in the house or running around the yard for limited periods of time is best. The French Bulldog Rescue Network notes that Frenchies are poor swimmers, and you will need to supervise this breed around a pool or other water sources.","Frenchies are smooth-coated dogs that tend to shed at a moderate rate. The breed requires little more than basic routine grooming, including weekly brushing. They lose their undercoat in the spring and fall, so owners may want to brush them more during those seasons. If your Frenchie is prone to skin issues, then baths with skin-soothing shampoo and regular ear cleaning may help. The deep skin folds might need a little attention to rid them of debris using a damp cloth or baby wipe, followed by being thoroughly dried. Trim your dog's nails every few weeks to prevent them from cracking or splitting. It's also recommended to practice preventative oral hygiene by brushing its teeth two to three times per week; this can help keep the breed's common gum infections and dental problems at bay.","Their charming, unique personalities, Great companions, Love to cuddle, Loyal, Smart","Farting, Prone to Separation Anxiety / Clingy, Health Issues, High Maintenance, Stubborn"
