The head is well-rounded, apple-shaped, and the muzzle is short and pointed with a well-defined stop.?', 'An elegant, observant, swift-moving, compact little dog with saucy expression, and with terrier-like qualities of temperament.?', 'Most historical references of the Chihuahua can be termed bewildering and obscure. A number of theories prevail regarding the origin of the breed. Both folklore and?archaeological findings?hint towards the fact that the breed originated in?Mexico. Arguably, the most relevant theory is that the Chihuahuas descended from the?Techichi, a companion dog favored by the?Toltec?civilization in Mexico.', 'Chihuahuas are prone to rheumatism, slipped stifle, colds and gum problems, corneal dryness and secondary glaucoma, due to their protruding eyes. They suffer from the tendency of gaining weight effortlessly. Exercise caution with toxic products, such as chocolate or fertilizers. This is a very small breed and it will not take much to poison the dogs of this breed. Chihuahuas are often born via a cesarean section because puppies are born with relatively large heads. They are susceptible to fractures and other mishaps in puppyhood. Some Chihuahuas have a molera, an unclosed section of the skull which can remain open forever. This makes the dog prone to injury. It has a tendency to wheeze and snore because of its small, short muzzles. This dog breed is vulnerable to?stress, caused by the owners? tendency to treat them like little babies.?', 'These little dogs are cut out for an apartment life. The Chihuahua adores warm weather and coldness repels it. They need space just like any other dog. Their small size does not imply that they can be kept in a small and confined space.', 'Although it is tempting to travel outside very often with these dainty creatures, in actuality, such little dogs only need one?daily walk. Proper and sufficient play can address most of their exercise needs, however, as is the case with all the breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that are left out of daily walks are more likely to display a wide variety of?behavior problems, as well as neurotic issues. They will also savor a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large, fenced-in yard.', 'The smooth, short haired coat should be gently brushed occasionally or simply wiped over with a damp cloth. The long coat should be brushed daily with a soft bristle brush. Bathe both types about once per month, while adopting precautionary measures to preclude water from penetrating the ears. Check the ears regularly and keep the nails trimmed. This breed is an average shedder', 'Chihuahuas are adorable.?Chihuahuas are suitable pets for apartment living.?Chihuahuas are proficient watch dogs.?Chihuahuas can be trained to use a litterbox indoors.Chihuahuas are straightforward to groom.', 'Chihuahuas can be fragile.?Some Chihuahuas are not recommended for young children.Chihuahuas are averse to freezing environments.Some Chihuahuas are not family dogs.Some Chihuahuas may tend to bark a lot.'),

The teeth converge in a slight undershot bite.', 'The large and protuberant eyes are dark in color. The small, thin ears are either rose or button shaped. The face is marked by large and deep wrinkles. The high-set tail is curled over the back and a double curl is preferred in the show ring.', 'The breed is heralded as one of the oldest canine breeds today. There are divergent theories, as regards the origin of the dog breed. But, most people are of the opinion that the breed is a descendant of the short-haired Pekingese', 'Pugs are easily susceptible to cold; hot and cold weather conditions repulse them. They are prone to allergies, and the short muzzle contributes to chronic breathing constraints, thereby making the Pug wheeze and snore at regular intervals. (Pugs suffer from poor ventilation.) Furthermore, pugs are afflicted with skin problems,?mast cell tumors, Pug Dog Encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation of the brain that affects adolescent Pugs usually between the ages of 2 and 3', 'The Pug is ordinarily well-suited to an apartment life. It stays idle and lackadaisical indoors, and a yard is not essential for them. A Pug usually fails to stand up to hot or cold weather in most of the scenarios, and should be kept indoors at a reasonable temperature', 'Pugs are brawny dogs with short, straight legs. They need to be taken on daily walks. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person leading the way forward,(this is essential as loyalty towards humans makes dogs set great store by them).Vigorous games keep them in good shape and regular exercise positively moulds their health. However, a surfeit of physical activities can backfire on their health, as they can then show symptoms of wheezing.', 'The smooth, shorthaired coat is easy to groom. Brush and comb with a firm bristle brush and shampoo only when necessary. Dry thoroughly after a bath so the dog does not get chilled. The creases on the face must be cleaned regularly. This breed is a seasonally heavy shedder', '?Pugs set a precedent as family pets because they get along well with other animals, like cats, other dogs, and even small children. Pugs are light-hearted and frolicsome. With their meaningful faces and snorty ways, they?re guaranteed to make you smile. If not, you probably need to pay a visit to a therapist.', 'Pugs tend to shed to an appreciable extent. Because of this nature of theirs, people unable to stand the sight are ill-advised to keep a pug as a pet. Dog hair and pugs go hand in hand. Pugs are voracious eaters. Hence, if a person is not too fond of bug-eyed manipulation, he/she should cast aside the decision of having a pug.'),

It has a long, straight muzzle. The dark, oval-shaped eyes are set somewhat far apart and are black or brown in color. The ears hang close to the head, and are long as well as flat. Both the front and back legs are in proportion with the size of the dog. The topline is even. The tail is set and carried high. It is sometimes docked to half its length or less to give the dog a more compact and balanced look.', 'The poodle is an industrious, wise and graceful dog, squarely built, and well-proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes, which are very dark in color and oval in shape, are a thorough reflection of its wakeful and astute nature. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.', 'Long before the Poodle was brought to England, the European mainland was well acquainted with the breed. Drawings by German artist?Albrecht D?rer?established the popular image of the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries. The paintings of the eminent Spanish artist Fransisco Goya are a testimony to the fact that it was the cardinal pet dog of the late 18th century in Spain. During the regime of Louis XVI, people in the neighboring France pampered and fancied toy poodles a lot.', 'They are vulnerable to cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), which may cause blindness,?IMHA (Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia), heart problems, diabetes, epilepsy, runny eyes, ear infections and skin allergies.?Brown Poodles are known for become prematurely', 'The Miniature Poodle is very much equipped to lead a settled apartment life. It will always be in a pleasant mind frame indoors, provided that enough exercise is given to it. A yard is non-essential for a poodle.', 'Miniature Poodles need a?daily walk.?While out on the walk make sure the dog heels beside or behind the person holding the lead, never in front, (this is essential as loyalty towards humans makes dogs set great store by them).?As with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to build up behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe, open area off lead, such as a large, fenced-in yard.?', 'An enormous amount of grooming is needed if the dog is to be shown. Poodles must be bathed regularly and clipped every six to eight weeks. Clean and check the ears frequently for wax or mites or infection and pull out hairs growing inside the ear canal. The teeth need regular scaling. Since the coat does not shed, it needs to be clipped.', 'There are a myriad of positive characteristics that make the poodle a pet lover?s choice. This dog is tremendously witty and persevering. Therefore, training of any kind would be readily accepted and mastered in a very short amount of time. The dog is the best choice for people set back by certain health issues as it is devoid of shedding.The sheer number of colors in which a Poodle is available makes it one of the most prized dogs. For instance, the Poodle comes in solid colors of white, gray, black, brown, apricot, cream, silver, and caf?-au-lait.', 'Grooming is not that essential, but since haircuts would be required every five to six weeks, be ready to bear the additional expenses. Exercising is a prerequisite for a poodle. Hence, if you lack a fenced backyard or someone in the family willing to provide daily walks and playtime, it is better to turn a blind eye to the Poodle. Nonetheless, if the activity needs of this breed could be met in a different manner, this would not be much of a headache.'),

They are trained to aid the blind. Sporting and hunting are also various fields where Labrador rules. They are one of the best search and rescue dogs.', 'labradors have a broad head and a wide muzzle, medium-sized, pendant ears and friendly eyes. The chest extends to the elbows and the forelegs should be straight, of solid bone, but not be too heavy. Show dogs need to have an athletic body that looks sturdy, but agile. The back is strong and topline is leve. It is medium length and thick at the base, covered in short, thick hair and tapers toward the tip. Labs, excellent swimmers, have webbed feet which come in handy while retrieving water fowl for hunters. The short, dense coat comes in three colors: black, chocolate or yellow.', 'The Labrador?s ancestors date back to 17th century Canada. During the 18th century, the Canadian water dogs differentiated into what we now know as the Newfoundland, the Landseer, the Flat-Coated Retriever, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever and the Labrador . Labs served as companions and helpers to local fishermen beginning in the 1700s. They originally were a breed of large working dogs from Swiss Alps to north Italy and Switzerland, and were originally bred for rescue. Labs are currently used for drug and explosive detection for search and rescue and also to provide assistance to the handicapped', 'Labrador are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they\'re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labs will get any or all of these diseases, but it\'s important to be aware of them if you\'re considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia?is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn\'t fit snugly into the hip joint. Elbow Dysplasia is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It\'s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones. Osteochondrosis Dissecans is an orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. Cataract as in humans,?canine cataracts?are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time.', 'Labrador are very adaptable dogs,?and will fit into all sort of living environments. However, they are energetic, particularly when younger, and it is therefore better for them to have some space and a garden or back yard in which to get some exercise.?', 'Because Labrador ?are energetic dogs, they do need regular exercise.?This will help to keep them healthy and happy as well as help to control their weight. These dogs love to play and can enjoy getting a great deal of exercise through play and interactive activity with their owners and family. Their love for company and people means that interactive play such as Frisbee, fetch etc. can provide them with mental stimulation as well as much-needed exercise.', 'Labradors shed heavily throughout the year. Regular brushing can help keep fly aways under control.. Baths are required quite often. Labs tend to smell ?like a dog? and enjoy getting down and dirty when outdoors. Labs, however, enjoy water and are not a problem to bathe at home.Check the ears on a regular basis for signs of wax buildup. Teeth should be brushed on a weekly basis. Trim nails monthly if the dog does not wear the toenails down naturally outdoors.', 'They are very energetic and \"puppy-like\" well into their senior years.They are very smart and therefore very trainable (they work in search and rescue, fire, police work, hunting, fishing, and a variety of dog competetions).They are great swimmers. Their hair is even water resistent so they dry really fast.?They are very affectionate.They are beautiful.', 'They are very energetic and \"puppy-like\" which can, at times, be trying. You shouldn\'t get one if you don\'t have time to give them strenuous exercise every week and walk and play fetch with them dailyThey are very smart. This can lead to them being very destructive and tricky. They will beg for food when they\'ve already been fed or find a way to open pantry doors.They are great swimmers. If you don\'t have a place to take your Lab to swim pretty often, it\'s kind of cruel to get one.'),

Its affectionate and happy-go-lucky attitude makes it a highly sought-after dog amongst the pet lover fraternity. Although they are extremely vibrant when young, in the subsequent stages of their lives, they become relaxed, pliant dogs that are loyal to their families, well-mannered with children and genial towards strangers. They are regarded as the best watchdogs as they’re quite social and seldom bark.', 'Siberian Huskies are powerful, compact, toiling sled dogs. The medium-sized head is in proportion to the body, with a muzzle that is equal in length to the skull, with a well-defined stop. The color of the nose depends upon the color of the dog\'s coat. It is black in gray, tan or black dogs, liver in copper dogs and flesh-colored in pure white dogs. The medium-sized, oval-shaped eyes are moderately spaced and come in blue, brown, amber or any combination thereof. Eyes can be half blue and half brown (parti-eyed), or dogs can have one blue eye and one brown eye (bi-eyed). The erect ears are triangular in shape, and set high up on the head. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. ', 'Breeds descending from the Eskimo dog or Qimmiq were once observed throughout the length and breadth of the Northern Hemisphere, in regions, such as Siberia, Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Labrador, and Baffin Island. With the help of Siberian Huskies, various tribes and clans were able not only to survive, but also succeeded in making strides towards the terra incognita. Admiral Robert Peary of the United States Navy pinned a lot of his hopes on this dog breed during his expeditions carried out in the North Pole', 'They can be susceptible to hip dysplasia, ectopy (displacement of the urethra), eye issues such as juvenile cataracts, PRA (primarily in male dogs), corneal dystrophy and crystalline corneal opacities. Breeders can get hip screenings from the OFA and eye screenings yearly from a canine ophthalmologist (AVCO) and register the exam through CERF and SHOR). They can also suffer from skin issues, known as zinc responsive dermatitis, which can be treated by giving zinc supplements.', 'They are not usually recommended for apartments, however, they can dwell comfortably in apartments if well-trained and properly exercised. Siberian Huskies are energetic and lively indoors, and their purpose is best served by a fenced-in large yard. Because of their heavy coats, these dogs have a liking for cool climates. To shield them from the heat, be sure to provide adequate shade and air conditioning. This breed prefers to live in packs.', 'Siberian Huskies need a fair amount of exercise, including a daily walk or jog, but should not be excessively exercised in warm weather. They need a large yard with a high fence, but bury the wire at the base of the fence because they are likely to dig their way out and go off hunting.', 'The coat sheds heavily twice a year. During that time they need to be brushed and combed daily.', 'Frisky and Ebullient A Good-Nature Breed Independent and Free-Spirited Convenient and Inexpensive Clean and Odorless Strikingly Appealing', 'Unrivalled Predatory Drive Stamina and Bouncines');
